# H1 Problem Statement::
The maintenance of 3D printers poses significant challenges due to the complexities of mechanical and electrical components, the lack of standardization across models, and the need for regular calibration. As a student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), we often encounter issues in troubleshooting. Additionally, besides the technical situations, we also face interruptions from 3rd parties. As a result, there is a reduction in print quality, downtime, and frustration at times. 

As a SUTD student who is well-versed in maneuvering such intricate challenges, the onus is on us to better the world with our knowledge.
