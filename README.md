### Crises
## Problem Statement
The maintenance of 3D printers poses significant challenges due to the complexities of mechanical and electrical components, the lack of standardization across models, and the need for regular calibration. As a student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), we often encounter issues in troubleshooting. Additionally, besides the technical situations, we also face interruptions from 3rd parties. As a result, there is a reduction in print quality, downtime, and frustration at times. 

As SUTD students well-versed in maneuvering such intricate challenges, we are on a mission to better the world with our knowledge.
## Background Story
This game was created for SUTDents in general, who use the schoolâ€™s Fabrication Lab (Fab Lab) frequently for projects. To prevent the student body from having potential meltdowns, the team, which some members have more experience with 3D printers, felt the urge to educate the student body so that no one would have the luxury of experiencing the devastation of having failed prints.

A game with occasional curveballs will equip SUTDents with the fundamental know-how to better navigate such a piece of complex machinery. 
## Scenario
The intended demographic is SUTDents in general, but it is not limited to them. Given the universal nature of the knowledge, anyone worldwide with access to 3D printers can play our fun and addictive game.

Having played our game, players can be reassured that they can tinker with 3D printers.
